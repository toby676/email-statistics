## How to install
Clone the repo, ensure bundler is installed then type `bundle install` into the console
Type `rake db:create` into the console to create the databases locally
Type `bin/rails s` to start the server

## Tech I used
I used rails as a framework and rspec/capybara for testing. These are tools I am conformable with and I knew I could quickly create this app using these tools.

## Improvements?
Adding an ID for each email and having the stats as a relation database could allow for better stat tracking. Currently the order/click tracking isn't tracking specific emails properly.
